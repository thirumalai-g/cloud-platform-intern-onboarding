Learning for Intern Onboarding - Krishna

## 1. Access Modifiers
**Concepts Covered:**
- Understanding the difference between **public**, **private**, and **protected** methods.
- How to access methods based on their access modifier.
- Practical use cases and when to use each modifier.

## 2. Basics
**Learned Concepts:**
- **Local Variables** (`varname`)
- **Instance Variables** (`@varname`)
- **Class Variables** (`@@varname`)
- **Global Variables** (`$varname`)

**Focus**: 
- Declaring and working with different types of variables in Ruby.

## 3. Collections
**Concepts Covered:**
- **Arrays**, **Strings**, and **Hashes**
  - Initialization and manipulation of these collections.
  - Accessing and modifying data within arrays, strings, and hashes.
  - Key methods used to work with collections.

## 4. Conditionals and Loops
**Concepts Covered:**
- Conditional Statements:
  - `if`, `elsif`, `else`
- Looping Constructs:
  - `for`, `while`, `each`
- Loop Control:
  - `redo`, `retry`, 'Break` , `Continue` 
  
**Focus**: 
- Implementing flow control and iteration in Ruby programs.

## 5. Data Abstraction
**Concepts Covered:**
- Understanding **data abstraction** and its application in problem-solving.
  
**Focus**: 
- Applying abstraction to hide complex implementation details and expose only necessary information.

## 6. Data Types
**Covered Types:**
- Numbers, Floats, Booleans, Strings, Arrays, Hashes, Symbols

**Focus**:
- Understanding and using Rubyâ€™s various data types.

## 7. Encapsulation
**Concepts Covered:**
- Understanding **encapsulation** and its benefits.
  
**Focus**: 
- Hiding internal object details and exposing only necessary information to users of the class.

## 8. Exception Handling
**Concepts Covered:**
- Raising and Handling Exceptions:
  - Using `raise`, `rescue`, `else`, and `ensure` to manage errors.
  
**Focus**: 
- Learning how to properly handle exceptions and ensure graceful error handling in Ruby programs.

## 9. File Handling
**Concepts Covered:**
- Creating, reading, and writing files in Ruby.
- File Operations:
  - `write`, `read`, `readlines`, and deleting files.

**Focus**:
- Practical skills for handling files within Ruby programs.

## 10. Method Overriding
**Concepts Covered:**
- Understanding and implementing **method overriding** in Ruby.
  
**Focus**: 
- Overriding inherited methods in subclasses to provide specialized behavior.

## 11. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
**Concepts Covered:**
- **Classes and Objects**: Understanding the structure and instantiation of Ruby classes.
- **Initialize Method**: Using `initialize` to set up object state.
- **Class Methods** (`self.method_name`): Defining and using class methods.
- **Class Variables** (`@@varname`): Understanding class-level variables.

## 12. Polymorphism
**Concepts Covered:**
- Achieving **polymorphism** in Ruby through:
  - **Inheritance**: Subclasses overriding methods of parent classes.
  - **Duck Typing**: Objects are defined by what they can do, not their class.
